# FileProtectorExample
 A C# File Protector Example was implemented with the File Control Filter Driver SDK. The File Control Filter Driver SDK is a kernel-mode component that runs as part of the Windows executive above the file system. The File Control Filter Driver SDK can intercept requests targeted at a file system or another file system filter driver. By intercepting the request before it reaches its intended target, the filter driver can extend or replace functionality provided by the original target of the request. The File Control Filter Driver SDK can log, observe, modify, or even prevent the I/O operations for one or more file systems or file system volumes.
